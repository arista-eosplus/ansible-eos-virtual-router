Virtual Router Role for EOS
===========================

The arista.eos-virtual-router role creates an abstraction for common EOS
virtual router configuration. This means that you do not need to write any
ansible tasks. Simply create an object that matches the requirements below
and this role will ingest that object and perform the necessary configuration.

This role is used to configure VARP-related configuration. There is
an assumption that the VARP configuration will be placed on Vlan interfaces.
This role will take care of creating those Vlans and configuring the IP address
for that Vlan interface if they do not already exist.

Installation
------------

```
ansible-galaxy install arista.eos-virtual-router
```


Requirements
------------

Requires an SSH connection for connectivity to your Arista device. You can use
any of the built-in eos connection variables, or the convenience ``provider``
dictionary.

Role Variables
--------------

The tasks in this role are driven by the ``virtual_mac_addr``,
``varp_interfaces`` objects described below:

**virtual_mac_addr**

|       Key        |  Type  | Notes                                    |
| :--------------: | :----: | ---------------------------------------- |
| virtual_mac_addr | string | The MAC address to assign as the virtual-router mac address. This value must be formatted like aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff |


**varp_interfaces** (list) each entry contains the following keys:

|            Key | Type                      | Notes                                    |
| -------------: | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|         vlanid | string (required)         | The Vlanid where the Varp configuration will be placed. |
|           name | string                    | The name given to the Vlan.              |
|    description | string                    | The description placed on the Vlan interface. |
|         enable | boolean: true*, false     | Enable or disable the Vlan and Vlan interface. |
| interface_addr | string                    | The IP address assigned to the Vlan interface. Of the form, X.X.X.X/Y |
|  virtual_addrs | list                      | A list of IP addresses that will be shared among the pair of switches in the virtual router configuration. Pre-configured IP addresses not in the list will be removed from the Vlan interface. |
|          state | choices: present*, absent | Set the state for the route configuration. |


```
Note: Asterisk (*) denotes the default value if none specified
```

Configuration Variables
-----------------------

|                     Key | Choices      | Description                              |
| ----------------------: | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| eos_save_running_config | true*, false | Specifies whether to write any changes to the running-config resulting from the role execution to memory, copying the configuration to the startup-config. |

```
Note: Asterisk (*) denotes the default value if none specified
```

Connection Variables
--------------------

Ansible EOS roles require the following connection information to establish
communication with the nodes in your inventory. This information can exist in
the Ansible group_vars or host_vars directories, or in the playbook itself.

|         Key | Required | Choices    | Description                              |
| ----------: | -------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|        host | yes      |            | Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified *transport*. The value of *host* is used as the destination address for the transport. |
|        port | no       |            | Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. This value applies to either acceptable value of *transport*. The port value will default to the appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task (cli=22, http=80, https=443). |
|    username | no       |            | Configures the usename to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.  The value of *username* is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the eAPI authentication depending on which *transport* is used. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead. |
|    password | no       |            | Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This is a common argument used for either acceptable value of *transport*. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead. |
| ssh_keyfile | no       |            | Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used when *transport=cli*. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead. |
|   authorize | no       | yes, no*   | Instructs the module to enter priviledged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to excecute all commands in non-priviledged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead. |
|   auth_pass | no       |            | Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device.  If *authorize=no*, then this argument does nothing. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead. |
|   transport | yes      | cli*, eapi | Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device. The *transport* argument supports connectivity to the device over cli (ssh) or eapi. |
|     use_ssl | no       | yes*, no   | Configures the transport to use SSL if set to true only when *transport=eapi*.  If *transport=cli*, this value is ignored. |
|    provider | no       |            | Convience method that allows all the above connection arguments to be passed as a dict object. All constraints (required, choices, etc) must be met either by individual arguments or values in this dict. |

```
Note: Asterisk (*) denotes the default value if none specified
```

Ansible Variables
-----------------

|    Key | Choices      | Description                              |
| -----: | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| no_log | true, false* | Prevents module arguments and output from being logged during the playbook execution. By default, no_log is set to true for tasks that gather and save EOS configuration information to reduce output size. Set to true to prevent all output other than task results. |

```
Note: Asterisk (*) denotes the default value if none specified
```


Dependencies
------------

The eos-virtual-router role is built on modules included in the core Ansible code.
These modules were added in ansible version 2.1

- Ansible 2.1.0

Example Playbook
----------------

The following example will use the arista.eos-virtual-router role to configure
the virtual-router mac address as well as Vlan interfaces with shared IP addresses.
We'll create a ``hosts`` files with our switches, then a corresponding
``host_vars`` file for each switch and then a simple playbook which only
references the eos-virtual-router role. By including the role, we automatically
get access to all of the tasks to configure these EOS features. What's nice
about this is that if you have a host without any corresponding configuration,
the tasks will be skipped without any issue.

For the example below, let's assume MLAG is already configured. Check out the
arista.eos-mlag role to quickly configure mlag.

Sample hosts file:

    [leafs]
    leaf1.example.com
    leaf2.example.com


Sample host_vars/leaf1.example.com

    provider:
      host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
      username: admin
      password: admin
      use_ssl: no
      authorize: yes
      transport: cli

    virtual_mac_addr: "00:1c:73:00:00:99"

    varp_interfaces:
      - vlanid: 1000
        name: Varp_Vlan1000
        state: absent
      - vlanid: 1001
        name: Varp_Vlan1001
        description: My Vlan1001
        enable: true
        interface_addr: 192.168.1.3/24
        virtual_addrs:
          - 192.168.1.1
          - 192.168.11.1
      - vlanid: 1002
        name: Varp_Vlan1002
        description: My Vlan1002
        enable: true
        interface_addr: 192.168.2.3/24
        virtual_addrs:
          - 192.168.2.1
          - 192.168.12.1


Sample host_vars/leaf2.example.com

    host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
    username: admin
    password: admin
    use_ssl: no
    authorize: yes
    transport: cli

    no_log: true

    virtual_mac_addr: "00:1c:73:00:00:99"

    varp_interfaces:
      - vlanid: 1001
        name: Varp_Vlan1001
        description: My Vlan1001
        enable: true
        interface_addr: 192.168.1.4/24
        virtual_addrs:
          - 192.168.1.1
          - 192.168.11.1
      - vlanid: 1002
        name: Varp_Vlan1002
        description: My Vlan1002
        enable: true
        interface_addr: 192.168.2.4/24
        virtual_addrs:
          - 192.168.2.1
          - 192.168.12.1


A simple playbook, leaf.yml

    - hosts: leafs
      roles:
        - arista.eos-virtual-router

Then run with:

    ansible-playbook -i hosts leaf.yml
â€‹
